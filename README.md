## Project Overview
- Use predictive analytics to predict future house price changes of different boroughs over time in London based on features like area, average_price, houses_sold, etc.
- The dataset can be obtained [here from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/housing-in-london).
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) is used to assist this project with Data Mining by extracting important insights using: 
  - [Basic Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics)
  - [Data Visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_and_information_visualization)
  - [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis)
  - [Supervised Machine Learning Models (Estimation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning)
    - [Decision Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning)
    - [Linear Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression)

## Motivation
- Besides making the decision based on affordability of the house alone, there are other factors such as the geographical location, population size, ease of transportation, etc that also affect the decision-making process.
- Likewise, the housing market in London has been rapidly growing since 1995, with an average of 10% yearly increase in housing prices in most years (Nationwide, 2015).
- However, this does not show London’s housing market is not without volatility. 
    - For example, does the major crisis such as the great recession affect the London’s house price industry?
- On the other hand, this may affect London homebuyers, sellers, or business partners who want to find out more about the trends of housing prices and change in various districts. 
    - For example, it is difficult to find sources about the trends of all the boroughs in London and the corresponding factors to them. 
    - For example, since the City of London district is a separate district on its own, will there be any consequences when buying houses in that district or will it perform just as well or better when compared to the other districts?



### Aim & Objective
- Aim: 
  - To apply an analytical framework from the datasets that can provide users with location-specific predictions and trends on the London housing market.
  - The outcome of the project should display the following information:
    - The leading factors and trends affecting the house price changes of different boroughs over time in London.
    - The prediction of future house price changes of different boroughs over time in London.

- Objective: 
  - To create and select the best Machine Learning model that estimates and predicts the future London house prices based on the importance of data variables and models evaluation and assessment (i.e. Accuracy, Recall, AUC, etc.). 
  - Through the acquiring of insights and extracted information, this may help assist buyers, hosts, or companies to make better decisions with their listing methods, property price range, business problems, etc.
